# Idofront

Idofront is a repository, shadowed by many of our plugins, which contains many useful helper functions. Some are exclusive in usefulness to code written in Kotlin.

This project is really new and not intended to be used by anyone for their own plugins yet! Don't expect any consistency or good code for now.
